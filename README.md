# Hi there, I'm Brix 👋🏻

I'm an embedded software/firmware engineer and a passionate open source developer. I started working on various open source projects back in the late 1990s and have not stopped since. I am mostly committed to writing low-level, hardware-near device drivers and communication protocols.

Over the years I have been working on various, in-house Linux and FreeBSD BSPs but lately my work (and my spare time) has shifted to working on the 🪁 [Zephyr Project](https://www.zephyrproject.org), a small real-time operating system (RTOS) for connected, resource-constrained embedded devices.
